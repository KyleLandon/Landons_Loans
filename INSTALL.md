# üè¶ Landon's Loans - Installation Guide

## Quick Installation Steps

### 1. Database Setup
Execute the SQL file in your MySQL/MariaDB database:
```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of sql/landons_loans.sql into your database management tool
-- This will create all required tables and indexes
```

### 2. Resource Installation
1. Place the `LandonsLoans` folder in your server's resources directory:
   ```
   resources/
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [qb]/
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LandonsLoans/
   ```

2. Add to your `server.cfg`:
   ```
   ensure LandonsLoans
   ```

### 3. Configuration
Edit `shared/config.lua` to match your server setup:

```lua
-- Update staff job names to match your server
Config.StaffJobs = {
    'police',    -- Change to your police job name
    'admin',     -- Change to your admin job name
    'banker'     -- Add any other staff jobs
}

-- Update ped location if needed
Config.LoanPed = {
    model = `a_m_m_business_01`,
    coords = vector4(-81.25, -835.7, 40.56, 159.15), -- Change if desired
    scenario = "WORLD_HUMAN_CLIPBOARD"
}
```

### 4. Testing Setup

#### For Development/Testing:
1. **Give yourself admin permissions** in your QBCore admin system
2. **Restart the server** or use `refresh` and `start LandonsLoans`
3. **Go to the loan office** at coordinates `-81.25, -835.7, 40.56`
4. **Test the interactions** with the loan officer ped

#### Initial Test Commands:
```
/creditcheck [your-citizenid]  -- Check your credit score
/loansmenu                     -- Open staff menu (if you have permissions)
```

### 5. Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:

**"No such export" errors:**
